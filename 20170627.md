### 內建函數 range\(\)

```python
>>> print(range(10))
```

range\(0, 10\)

```python
```pythonprint(type(range(10)))
```

&lt;class 'range'&gt;

```python
print(list(range(10)))
```

\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\]

```python
print(list(range(0, 10)))
```

\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\]

```python
print(list(range(0, 10, 2)))
```

\[0, 2, 4, 6, 8\]

```python
print(list(range(9, -1, -1)))
```

\[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0\]



Make the loop print the numbers from 0 to 19 instead of 0 to 9.

```python
print "Counting..."
for i in range(0,20):
    print i
```

Using strings in lists in functions

```py
n = ["Michael", "Lieberman"]
def join_strings(words):
    result = ""
    for i in words:
        result = result + i
    return result
print join_strings(n)
```

Using two lists as two arguments in a function

```python
m = [1, 2, 3]
n = [4, 5, 6]
# Add your code here!
def join_lists(a, b):
    return a + b
print join_lists(m, n)
# You want this to print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

\[1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6\]

Using a list of lists in a function

```python
n = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]
for lst in n:
    print lst
    for item in lst:
        print item
```

### 內建函數 append\(\)

把input輸入的內容新增到list

```py
hobbies = []
for x in range(0,3):
    newhobbies = raw_input("your new hobbies")
    hobbies.append(str(newhobbies))
    
print hobbies
```



```python
n = [[1, 2], [4, 5, 6, 7]]
def flatten(lists):
    results = [ ]
    for x in lists:
        for j in x:
            results.append(j)
    return results

print flatten(n)
```

```python
board = []
for x in range(0,5):
    board.append('0')
for i in range(0,5):
    print board
```

or

```python
board = []
for n in range(5):
    board.append('O' )
def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print board
print_board(board)
```

\[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\]

\[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\]

\[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\]

\[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\]

\[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\]

```python
board = []
for n in range(5):
    board.append(['O'] * 5)
print board
```

\[\[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\] , \[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\] , \[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\] , \[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\] , \[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\]\]

```python
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
print " ".join(letters)
print "---".join(letters)
```

a b c d

a---b---c---d---

```python
board = []
for x in range(0,5):
   board.append(["O"] * 5)
def print_board(board):
  for row in board:
    print " ".join(row)

print_board(board)
```

### While/else

```python
import random
print "Lucky Numbers! 3 numbers will be generated."
print "If one of them is a '5', you lose!"
count = 0
while count < 3:
    num = random.randint(1, 6)
    print num
    if num == 5:
        print "Sorry, you lose!"
        break
    count += 1
else:
    print "You win!"
```



猜數字遊戲

```python
from random import randint
random_number = randint(1, 10)
guesses_left = 3
# Start your game!
while guesses_left > 0:
    guess = int(raw_input("Your guess: "))
    if guess == random_number:
        print "You win!"
        break
    guesses_left -= 1
else:
    print random_number
    print "You lose."
```



取代

```python
phrase = "A bird in the hand..."
s = ""
for x in phrase:
    if x == 'A' or x == 'a':
        s = s + 'X'
    else:
        s = s + x
print s
```

X bird in the hand...



The`,`character after our

`print`statement means that our next`print`

statement keeps printing on the same line.

```python
phrase = "A bird in the hand..."
# Add your for loop
for char in phrase:
    if char == 'A' or char == 'a':
        print 'X',
    else:
        print char,
print
```

X bird in the hand...
