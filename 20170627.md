### 內建函數 range\(\)

```python
>>> print(range(10))
```

range\(0, 10\)

```python
```pythonprint(type(range(10)))
```

&lt;class 'range'&gt;

```python
print(list(range(10)))
```

\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\]

```python
print(list(range(0, 10)))
```

\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\]

```python
print(list(range(0, 10, 2)))
```

\[0, 2, 4, 6, 8\]

```python
print(list(range(9, -1, -1)))
```

\[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0\]

Make the loop print the numbers from 0 to 19 instead of 0 to 9.

```python
print "Counting..."
for i in range(0,20):
    print i
```

Using strings in lists in functions

```py
n = ["Michael", "Lieberman"]
def join_strings(words):
    result = ""
    for i in words:
        result = result + i
    return result
print join_strings(n)
```

Using two lists as two arguments in a function

```python
m = [1, 2, 3]
n = [4, 5, 6]
# Add your code here!
def join_lists(a, b):
    return a + b
print join_lists(m, n)
# You want this to print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

\[1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6\]

Using a list of lists in a function

```python
n = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]
for lst in n:
    print lst
    for item in lst:
        print item
```

### 內建函數 append\(\)

把input輸入的內容新增到list

```py
hobbies = []
for x in range(0,3):
    newhobbies = raw_input("your new hobbies")
    hobbies.append(str(newhobbies))

print hobbies
```

```python
n = [[1, 2], [4, 5, 6, 7]]
def flatten(lists):
    results = [ ]
    for x in lists:
        for j in x:
            results.append(j)
    return results

print flatten(n)
```

```python
board = []
for x in range(0,5):
    board.append('0')
for i in range(0,5):
    print board
```

or

```python
board = []
for n in range(5):
    board.append('O' )
def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print board
print_board(board)
```

\[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\]

\[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\]

\[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\]

\[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\]

\[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\]

```python
board = []
for n in range(5):
    board.append(['O'] * 5)
print board
```

\[\[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\] , \[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\] , \[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\] , \[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\] , \[0,  0,  0,  0,  0\]\]

```python
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
print " ".join(letters)
print "---".join(letters)
```

a b c d

a---b---c---d---

```python
board = []
for x in range(0,5):
   board.append(["O"] * 5)
def print_board(board):
  for row in board:
    print " ".join(row)

print_board(board)
```

---

### While/else

```python
import random
print "Lucky Numbers! 3 numbers will be generated."
print "If one of them is a '5', you lose!"
count = 0
while count < 3:
    num = random.randint(1, 6)
    print num
    if num == 5:
        print "Sorry, you lose!"
        break
    count += 1
else:
    print "You win!"
```

猜數字遊戲

```python
from random import randint
random_number = randint(1, 10)
guesses_left = 3
# Start your game!
while guesses_left > 0:
    guess = int(raw_input("Your guess: "))
    if guess == random_number:
        print "You win!"
        break
    guesses_left -= 1
else:
    print random_number
    print "You lose."
```

取代

```python
phrase = "A bird in the hand..."
s = ""
for x in phrase:
    if x == 'A' or x == 'a':
        s = s + 'X'
    else:
        s = s + x
print s
```

X bird in the hand...

The`,`character after our

`print`statement means that our next`print`

statement keeps printing on the same line.

```python
phrase = "A bird in the hand..."
# Add your for loop
for char in phrase:
    if char == 'A' or char == 'a':
        print 'X',
    else:
        print char,
print
```

X bird in the hand...

### For/else

Just like with`while`,`for`loops may have an`else`associated with them.

```python
fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'tomato', 'pear', 'grape']
print 'You have...'
for f in fruits:
    if f == 'tomato':
        print 'A tomato is not a fruit!' 
        break #到tomato就會停止
    print 'A', f
else:
    print 'A fine selection of fruits!'
```

You have...

A banana

A apple

A orange

A tomato is not a fruit!

```python
#沒有break的版本
fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'tomato', 'pear', 'grape']
print 'You have...'
for f in fruits:
    if f == 'tomato':
        print 'A tomato is not a fruit!' 
    print 'A', f
else:
    print 'A fine selection of fruits!'
```

You have...

A banana

A apple

A orange

A tomato is not a fruit!

A tomato

A pear

A grape

A fine selection of fruits!

Looping over a dictionary

```python
d = {'a': 'apple', 'b': 'berry', 'c': 'cherry'}
for key in d:
    # Your code here!
    #if d[key] == 'berry':
    print key, d[key]
```

a apple

b berry

c cherry

### 內建函數enumerate\(\)

`enumerate`works by supplying a corresponding index to each element in the list that you pass it. Each time you go through the loop,

`index`will be one greater, and`item`will be the next item in the sequence. It's very similar to using a normal`for`loop with a list, except this gives us an easy way to count how many items we've seen so far

```python
choices = ['pizza', 'pasta', 'salad', 'nachos']
print 'Your choices are:'
for index, item in enumerate(choices):
    print index+1, item
    # index從0開始所以+1
```

Your choices are:

1 pizza

2 pasta

3 salad

4 nachos

---

### 內建函數zip\(\)

`zip`will create pairs of elements when passed two lists, and will stop at the end of the shorter list.`zip`can handle three or more lists as well!

```python
#zip()用來混合list_a & list_b
list_a = [3, 9, 17, 15, 19]
list_b = [2, 4, 8, 10, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
for a, b in zip(list_a, list_b):
    # Add your code here!
    #print a,b 列出ab 
    if a > b: #a,b比大小
        print a
    else:
        print b
```

3

9

17

15

30

### 內建函數sum\(\) , float\(\)

```py
grades = [100, 100, 90, 40, 80, 100, 85, 70, 90, 65, 90, 85, 50.5]
def grades_sum(scores):
    total = sum(scores) 
    #sum 自動總和
    return total

def grades_average(scores):
    return grades_sum(scores)/float(len(scores))
    #float轉換成浮點數
    #len()長度（list數量）
print grades_average(grades)
```

---

Standard Deviation:

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

```python
grades = [100, 100, 90, 40, 80, 100, 85, 70, 90, 65, 90, 85, 50.5]

# all the grades
def print_grades(grades):
    for grade in grades:
        print grade
# sum of grades        
def grades_sum(grades): 
    total = 0
    for grade in grades: 
        total += grade
    return total
# average of grades
def grades_average(grades):
    sum_of_grades = grades_sum(grades)
    average = sum_of_grades / float(len(grades))
    return average
# variance of grades
def  grades_variance(scores):
    average = grades_average(scores)
    variance = 0
    for score in scores:
        variance += (average - score) ** 2
        result = variance/float(len(scores))
    return result 
# deviation of grades
def grades_std_deviation(variance):
    return variance ** 0.5 #開根號

variance = grades_std_deviation(grades_variance(grades))
#取得variance的值再計算deviation
print (variance)
```
